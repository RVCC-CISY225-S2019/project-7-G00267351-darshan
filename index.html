            <h1> Fast food-Main cause of obesity </h1>
            <div class="story-body">
               <p> &emsp;&emsp;Obesity is a disease that causes weight gain and many different problems of heart and stomach that may kill a person. Obesity in United states is increasing day by day and now it has become the endemic disease. It is found that
                majority of obesity cases are due to eating more fast food. In the article, “Don’t Blame the Eater”, David Zinczenko has explained how eating fast food had make people obese, where as in the article, “Escape from western Diet”, Pollan
                has explained that how fast food is made, processed and people relying on fast food become obese. Here, although both author’s Zincenko and Pollan provides same argument that obesity is caused by eating more fast food, Pollan sounds more
                convincing because of the outside authoritative facts that he provides about harmful chemicals used in food, and how it affects not only to humans but also to nature. </p>

            <p> &emsp;&emsp;Pollan clearly explains that how harmful chemicals used in fast food affects the human health. Pollan tries to give reliable facts and explain that chemicals used during processing of fast food are very harmful and not only make
                people obese but also causes many different diseases than obesity. For instance to prove his point, Pollan addresses the industries and says, “For the industry it’s obviously preferable to have a scientific rationale for further processing
                foods-whether by lowering the fat or carbs or by boosting omega-3s or fortofyling them with antioxidants and probiotics-than to entertain seriously the proposition that processed foods of any kind are a big part of the problem.” (422).
                Here, pollan uses the facts that industries are using products that are more in fats and chemicals to make food. So he suggests the industries and tries to explain that industries should try to make products that are free of chemicals
                or that have low fat content so as to increase the rate of obesity. Thus, Pollan sounds more convincing as he tries to explain by the facts the industries uses chemicals to make fast food and they should reduce the use of chemicals as
                food containing fats and carbs make people fat.</p>

            <p> &emsp;&emsp;In contrast, although Zinczenko claims through his personal experience that fast food causes obesity, unlike Pollan he does not mention that what ingredients involved in fast food has made him obese. Zinczenko provides his personal
                experience and explains how he got fat because of eating fast food. For instance Zinczenko says, “Lunch and dinner, for me, was a daily choice between McDonald’s, Taco Bell, Kentucky fried Chicken or Pizza Hut. Then as now, these were
                the only available options for an american kid to get an affordable meal. By age 15. I had packed 212 pounds of torpid teenage tallow on my once lanky 5 foot-10-frame.”(462-463). Here, he explains that by eating fast food he gained weight
                when he was kid, but he didn’t explain thaT what ingredients in the fast food made him fat. Thus, as Zinczenko focuses only on fast food not on specific ingredients that made him fat, he provides less convincing argument than Pollan who
                explains that fats and carbs involved in fast food proves dangerous and industries should reduce the use of it while processing fast food. </p>

            <p> &emsp;&emsp;Furthermore, Pollan sounds more stronger due to the facts that he provides that chemicals used in fast food only harms humans but it also harms the environment. Pollan tries to explain the ecological relationships between plants,
                animals, and human, and explains that how harm to one thing can directly or indirectly affect other and finally leading damage to whole ecosystem. To prove his point Pollan says, “Food consists not just in piles of chemicals; it also comprises
                a set of social and ecological relationships, reaching back to the land and outward to other people.” (425). In other words, Pollan explains that food processed not only has chemicals and other harmful substances, but it also consists
                of relationship of other creature living in the ecosystem and by killing animals we are breaking the food chain of other creatures living in the ecosystem. Pollan explains that the soil in which we grow food has some insects necessary
                for the cultivation, and if we kill all animals and such insects than that soil will lack that and will affect the cultivation. Thus, Pollan’s information that chemicals used in food not only makes people obese but also harms the environment
                sounds stronger. </p>

            <p> &emsp;&emsp;In contrast, zinczenko provides the argument that fast food harms humans in many different ways but, unlike, Pollan he doesn’t provide that in what other ways does fast food harms humans. Zincenko only focuses on fast food causing
                obesity. For example he says, “Fast Fast food companies are marketing to children a produven health hazard and no warning labels.”(464). Here, he only explains that fast food is causing harm to humans and making them obese. He focuses
                only on one point. But as Pollan Zinczenko doesn’t provide any information that besides health in what other ways fast food is harmful .thus, zinczenko proves to be weaker than Pollan. </p>

            <p> &emsp;&emsp;All in all, Pollan provides stronger information that chemicals in fast food harms human and environment many different ways than Zinczenko who sounds weaker due to his specific information that fast food cause only obesity. Fast
                food and obesity problems are increasing day by day in United States and special attempts should be made according to the above articles to reduce it. Obesity is not only diseases caused by fast food, but many other diseases like heart
                problems, high cholesterol levels, diabetes, and so on are also caused by fast food and person candie if not controlled on time. Thus, obesity problems should be controlled by controlling the consumption of fast food. </p>
